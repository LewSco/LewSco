- 👋 Hi, I’m Lewis @LewSco.
- 👀 I’m currently interested in improving my programming skills in both C# and Unreal, and getting practice in making game AI.
- 🌱 I’m currently on a Games Developement NC course with edinburgh college and will be moving onto the HND after summer. I'm learning coding in both C# and Unreal. 
- 🕹️ My main inspirations are Alien Isolation for its use of an AI director, Spelunky for its predictable, yet challenging AI plus its level generation, and lastly the Metal Gear Solid series for its guard AI and use of finite state machines.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on game projects requiring a programmer, especially if they involve issues I've never experienced before. It would be exciting to learn while woking on a project and tackling problems together in a team. 

- 🛠️ Currently working on planning and prototyping the systems for a game.
