# Who am I?

- 👋 Hi, I’m Lewis @LewSco.
- 👀 I’m currently interested in pathfinding and procedural generation.
- 🌱 I’m on a Games Development course with Edinburgh Napier University. I'm learning to make games in C++ and C#.
- :nerd_face: I have been playing a lot of chess recently in between uni projects, as well as taking an interest in other board games.
